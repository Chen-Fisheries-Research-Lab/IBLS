# IBLS
An individual-based lobster simulator (IBLS) that allows users to simulate the American lobster fishery in the state of Maine. The IBLS was developed by Chen et al. (2005) to test the performance of the stock assessment model, further developed by Chang (2015) for management evaluation, and modified and parameterized for the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery by Mazur et al. (2018).
