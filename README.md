# IBLS
An individual-based lobster simulator (IBLS) that allows users to simulate the Gulf of Maine (GOM) American lobster fishery. The IBLS was developed by Chen et al. (2005) to test the performance of the stock assessment model, further developed by Chang (2015) for management evaluation, and modified and parameterized for the GOM lobster fishery by Mazur et al. (2018). An individual-based model was used to develop the IBLS for the GOM lobster ﬁshery by expressing numerous components of the model equations as random Bernoulli trials (Chen et al. 2005; Chang 2015; Mazur et al. 2018). Insteadofcalculatingthe number of lobsters that survive a given process such as natural mortality or ﬁshing mortality, we simulate natural or ﬁshing mortality acting on Nt individual lobsters (Mazur et al. 2018).

# Input
The IBLS requires abundance, recruitment, and other types of data (Table 1).
